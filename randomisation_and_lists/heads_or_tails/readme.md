# Heads or Tails

## Instructions

You are going to write a virtual coin toss program. It will randomly tell the user "Heads" or "Tails". 

**Important**, the first letter should be capitalised and spelt exactly like in the example e.g. Heads, not heads.

Generate a random number, either 0 or 1. Then use that number to print out Heads or Tails.

e.g.
1 means Heads
0 means Tails 

## Example Output

```
Heads
```

or

```
Tails
```
